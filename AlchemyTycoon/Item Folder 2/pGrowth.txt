The Growth Elixir has a rather amusing story to its origin, in that it was devised by a young man at university, who was profoundly jealous of a colleague's long and thick beard. He reasoned that if he could speed up the growth of his beard, he could outclass his fellows with volume alone.
Drinking an elixir of growth causes the body to "speed up," as it were. A foot of hair will grow in an hour, nails will stretch and extend, and mounds of dry skin will flake off. It's mostly used as a means to speed up otherwise-slow natural healing processes.
