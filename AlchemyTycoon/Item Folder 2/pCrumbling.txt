First compounded in the ages-old ritual site of Wolfsmaw Point, the Crumbling Decoction first gained fame amongst the Druidic Circles, but eventually grew to nearly all apothecaries, woodsfolk, barbers, and medics. It was decried by many mages as too dangerous for use, but its popularity hasn't waned.
When the Crumbling Decoction hits the bloodstream, it grants the subject a sort of fell Midas Touch--anything the subject touches turns to stone. If they hold their hand in place, the stone spreads, eventually enveloping the whole of the obejct touched. While this has an obviously deadly implication, it also has incredible medical uses, as it can quickly and easily remove anything from warts to cancer.
