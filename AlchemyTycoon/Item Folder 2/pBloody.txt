While it has its origins in a torturer's oubliette, the Bloody Remedy has become extremely valuable in medicine, as it can be used both as a means to dispel illness, but also to quickly gain blood from healthy patients that can be used for transfusions.
The drink has a strange, coppery taste to it. An hour or two after drinking it, the subject will suddenly feel extremely hot, then cold, and then begin bleeding profusely from every orifice. Afterwards, any blood-borne diseases will be gone.
