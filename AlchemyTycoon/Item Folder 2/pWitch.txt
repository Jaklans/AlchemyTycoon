Originally created by the ancient hag Grammy Verla, Witch's Wash quickly spread throughout the occult community, eventually hitting the mainstream. It recieved some pushback from the more pious orders on the Continent, but was eventually accepted due to its usefulness.
Witch's Wash is not precisely a potion. Rather it is type of oil that can be spread over nearly any surface to both make it glow an eerie green, and to slowly wither any growing thing it touches. While this obviously dangerous, its ultimate use was discovered in its ability to make extremely long-lasting lamps that would eradicate any and all flying insects that normally swarm near such lights.
