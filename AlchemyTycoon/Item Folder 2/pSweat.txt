The legend of Pigsweat's origin is fairly well known. It was created by a wandering jester, who was hoping to make a point about the naming of things. Pigsweat has an incredibly sweet, tangy, and delicious taste, yet nearly every noble who was offered the drink rejected it on name alone.
Beyond its pleasant Taste, Pigsweat has the odd property of it makes the subject stay clean, regardless of substance they pass through. Mud will not stick to the skin, sand runs off easily, and blood is wiped away on contact.
