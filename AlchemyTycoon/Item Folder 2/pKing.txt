King's Dram, first known as "The Best Booze Ever," has its roots in small-time Dwarven breweries deep in the Aldermore Hills. A tiny phial is expensive at best, while a bottle is prohibitively expensive. There has never been an instance of an entire cask of King's Dram existing in one place in recorded history.
With a few drops in the belly, the subject will become drunk very quickly. They will then stay in this state for precisely six hours, at which point it will wear off completely, with no ill after-effects.
