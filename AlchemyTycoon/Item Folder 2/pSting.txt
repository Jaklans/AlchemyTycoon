Stinging Soda, unsurprisingly, began in the Orcish raiding camps deep in the hills, where there is little else to do. It was initially a test of machismo and naught else, but the tradition spread, and its other uses were discovered.
While it does have a painful effect on the throat while being drunk, Stinging Soda's main benefit is that is an extremely effective purgative--any remnants of disease or plague remaining in the gut are expelled within a day or two, without issue.
