While its initial conception caused widespread panic and outcry, after some time in the market, the Demon's Mixture is now mostly used on holy days and festivals, and amongst performers.
Once drunken in its entirety, the Demon's Mixture causes the subject to take on a ghastly and horrfiying visage, one not unlike a demon. Terror typically ensues.
