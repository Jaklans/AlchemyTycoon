Nip-of-a-Harlot's creation, unsurprisingly, started in a street house. The bartenders were trained to watch for exceptionally strange or callous patrons, and would slip a drop or two of this into their drinks, fully ending any desires those patrons had.
Sometimes described as an "anti-love-potion," this tasty potion will cause a sudden repression of nearly all feelings, especially romantic ones. The drinker will instead feel calm, collected, and sometimes possessing of a sudden desire to read a nice, long book.
