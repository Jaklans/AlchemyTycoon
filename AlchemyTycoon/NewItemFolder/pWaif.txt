The creation of the Waif's Brew is something of a mystery, but legends state that it was devised by a poor, lonely girl who'd been bullied unceasingly. She concocted this foul potion to resemble a ghost, so she could turn the tables, and haunt her tormentors herself.
Upon consumption, the drinker finds themselves suddenly a few dozen pounds lighter, and gain the ability to float. However, they take on a ghastly appearance, resembling a hollow, deadened version of themselves.
