Originally devised by the rebel group Crown's Shard, the Squirrel Tonic has since been co-opted by nearly every military force in the world. It can be used sustain long forced marches that would otherwise collapse within a day or two.
The most distinctive feeling after consuming Squirrel Tonic is a sudden nervousness, sometimes bordering on paranoia. Beyond that, however, the tonic allows the subject to suddenly move at a much quicker pace than previously--they find themselves willing and able to travel long distances without worry or tiring.
