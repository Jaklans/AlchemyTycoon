Azhkezar, the famously exotic city of wonders and miracles to the far West, decided to capitalize on their fame somewhat by producing a wide line of Azhkezarian products, spearheaded by the now-somewhat infamous Taste of Azhkezar.
Taste of Azhkezar is, for all intents and purposes, lemon-y water. It's reputed to cause an intense desire to go out to the nearest market and spend all of one's gold on cheap knick-knacks, but those effects were eventually disproven in an exhaustive study by the Alchemical Board of Azhkezar.
