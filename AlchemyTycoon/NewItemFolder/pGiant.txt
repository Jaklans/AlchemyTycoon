The fact that Giant Medecine was not invented by giants themselves is a source of un-ending sadness and disappointment for many aspiring alchemists the world over. Rather, it was such powerful medicine that it was believed for many years that it could heal a giant as well as it could any humanoid.
Many healing potions exist, but the regenerative powers of Giant medicine are unmatched. It is used mostly by military medics to heal their wounded soldiers, as a few swallows of the drink can cause an arm or leg to regrow, bones to come together, and blind eyes to see.
