The Continental Guild of Alchemy has multiple conflicting accounts of how the potion known as Dose o' Moonshine came to be. Some say it was brewed by Orcish slavers, others say it was devised by a dragon struck with madness, while some say it always has been, since time immemorial.
The effects vary. Some subjects find themselves entirely unchanged, others find immense physical and mental strength they previously lacked, some suffer profound boredom, while others feel a sort of kinship with the natural world around them, regardless of previous dispositions.
