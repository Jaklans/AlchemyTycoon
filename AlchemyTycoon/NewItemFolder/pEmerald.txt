Emerald Fountains have their origins in druidic circles, born out of a desire to bond even further with nature and the wilds. It eventually entered the main markets, where it was popular with carefree youths, as well as the extreme elderly.
Once consumed, the subject will suddenly have an immense and inescapable desire to wander into a forest, lie amongst the plants, and frolic with the creatures therein. Interestingly, those under the Fountain's effects are usually safe from wild beasts and other dangers forests typically present.
