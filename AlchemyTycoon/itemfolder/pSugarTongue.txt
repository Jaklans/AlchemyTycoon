This potion was first created by the arcanist Balthazar Van Krout, a famously fouled-mouth man. He was seeking to court a beauty he admired, and so devised the Sugartongue. Many courtiers now will put a drop of it in their wine before going before their ruler.
When consumed, one finds oneself unable to utter anything but the most flattering and delightsome of compliments, whether they be true or false. While this can cause downsides, many less-eloquent folk find it extremely useful.
